    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Designless is a tool for creating print and PDF documents with <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" target="_blank">Markdown</a>, a great format for minimalist writing. With Designless you can write in plain text without any distractions and then design a beautiful print document in your browser. You can print your document with the print icon in the header, or export a pixel-perfect PDF file.</p>
    <p>Write your content in your favorite editor (<a href="http://bywordapp.com/" target="_blank">Byword</a>, <a href="https://ia.net/writer/mac/" target="_blank">iA Writer</a>,<a href="http://www.vim.org/" target="_blank">Vim</a>) and design beautiful print documents in the browser with an innovative box model and open source layout format.</p>
    <p>Designless uses an open format for storing layout data, and Markdown for storing your content, meaning you will never have to <a href="http://ben.balter.com/2014/03/31/word-versus-markdown-more-than-mere-semantics/" target="_blank">'jailbreak' your own content</a>. As all your data is stored in plain text, you can use any app for writing - and version your writing and layout design with Git!</p>
