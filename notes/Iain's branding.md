Very good to hear from you. I like the idea - the real trick is turning it into something that feels instantly highly usable that is very easy to explain. Make it granny-proof as we say. The general rule of thumb is if you can't sell it easily in 20 seconds you will lose most people and end up being very niche. So I think you need to dumb it down if possible - most of the stuff on your front page should probably be in an 'about section' not the main sell. I think talking too much upfront about Markdown and the other linked tools detracts from what you are doing even though they play a critical role. You need to lead with something that is succinct and to the point (like "Create beautiful documents simply.") then go onto explain the benefits (smaller, less bloat, browser based etc). Finish up with the tech parts for those who are interested. Just my humble opinion!

A 30 sec vid would be good. + Some examples etc. Maybe a quick tutorial. Then all you need to do is find the people who need it! (That's the tough part!)
