#Structure:

Have database sorta structure like this:

Sections, which can take less than a page, 1 page or more than a page
then elements (html style) which go inside sections

have a unique id for each element and the sections manage the location of these IDs




Have boxes which can be nested


Modes for distributing boxes inside boxes:

- Even tile verticle
- Even tile horizontal
- Horizontal flow
- Vertical flow
- Absolute



Each box stores it's children and their co-ordinates (or flow style)


Each box can have its own style attributes
Boxes inherit attribute (HTML style)


Store all values as cm
Make the main() box the size of the sheet
Images and colour boxes just appear as elements
