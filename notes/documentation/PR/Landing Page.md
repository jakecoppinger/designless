Designless is a tool for creating print and PDF documents with [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), a great format for minimalist writing. With Designless you can write in plain text without any distractions and then design a beautiful print document in your browser. You can print your document with the print icon in the header, or export a pixel-perfect PDF file.

Write your content in your favorite editor ([Byword](http://bywordapp.com/), [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer/mac/),[Vim](http://www.vim.org/)) and design beautiful print documents in the browser with an innovative box model and open source layout format.

Designless uses an open format for storing layout data, and Markdown for storing your content, meaning you will never have to ['jailbreak' your own content](http://ben.balter.com/2014/03/31/word-versus-markdown-more-than-mere-semantics/). As all your data is stored in plain text, you can use any app for writing - and version your writing and layout design with Git!
