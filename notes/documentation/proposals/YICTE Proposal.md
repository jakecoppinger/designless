1. ABSTRACT  –  max 150 words
Provide a short summary telling us about your project and what you hoped to achieve?

A Markdown-based desktop publishing platform in the browser

For plain text writing, Markdown is quickly becoming a popular document format choice for writers. It allows the author to write in plain text and use simple symbols to create structure - for example you can either use an asterisk (*really?*) for italics, or two asterisks for bold (**really!**). It is more transparent and structured than a Word document but more human friendly than HTML or LaTeX. The problem is that there is no straightforward way of designing the layout of a printed document using this format. I propose a modern web app which makes use of Markdown for writing and a drag and drop interface for designing the layout of the page. By storing the layout of the page elements in a simple plain text format, versoning software like git could track changes of the content the layout enabling powerful collaboration.


2. INTRODUCTION – max 50 words
What inspired the idea for your project?

I discovered Markdown from the Readme pages of Github and now I use it for all my writing. I love great design so I end up having to copy each paragraph into an application like InDesign. I believe a complete writing and design solution could be immensly disruptive.

3. PROBLEM STATEMENT – max 50 words
Explain the problem you are trying to solve with your project?

By creating a browser based writing and design application, users can write Markdown in the browser (or program of choice, eg. iA Writer, Vim,Emacs) and design beautiful documents - while tracking changes and collaborating with Git. Colaboration and version control for design is currently impossible.

Design and Features – max 75 words
tell us about the design and some of the features of your project?

The application will run in the browser and will have two modes, a minimalist writing mode and a layout mode. By connecting to Dropbox or GitHub the user will be able to work from any computer. I envision a nested box model interface for the layout mode where boxes are the base unit, and can be nested to easily create complex designs - a revolutionary approach to the problem of brilliant graphic design.

Challenges Designing and Building this Project – max 75 words
what challenges did you have when designing and building your project?

Creating a great user experience in web apps is hard, but it can be done - by using modern web technologies like HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript libraries I will create a productive application. The box model structure and user experience needs to be spot on as this will be the truely innovative aspect of my application, and I will ship this part of the project in the Minimum Viable Product in Week 6 of Q3.
